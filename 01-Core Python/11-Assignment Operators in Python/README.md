# Assignment Operators in Python

In Python, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They are a shorthand way of performing an operation on a variable and then assigning the result back to the variable. Here are the assignment operators in Python along with examples of their usage:


## Assignment (=): 
Assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

```python
x = 5  # Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
```

## Addition Assignment (+=): 
Adds the value on the right-hand side to the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.

```python
x += 3  # Equivalent to: x = x + 3
```

## Subtraction Assignment (-=): 
Subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.

```python
x -= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x - 2
```

## Multiplication Assignment (*=): 
Multiplies the variable by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.

```python
x *= 4  # Equivalent to: x = x * 4
```

## Division Assignment (/=): 
Divides the variable by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.

```python
x /= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x / 2
```

## Modulus Assignment (%=): 
Computes the modulus of the variable and the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.

```python
x %= 3  # Equivalent to: x = x % 3
```

## Floor Division Assignment (//=): 
Performs floor division on the variable and the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.

```python
x //= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x // 2
```

## Exponentiation Assignment (**=): 
Raises the variable to the power of the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.

```python
x **= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x ** 2
```

Assignment operators are commonly used to modify the value of a variable based on some computation in a concise manner. Understanding and using assignment operators can make your code more readable and efficient.
