#Assignment (=): Assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
x = 5  # Assigns the value 5 to the variable x

# Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the value on the right-hand side to the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.
x += 3  # Equivalent to: x = x + 3

# Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.
x -= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x - 2

# Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the variable by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.
x *= 4  # Equivalent to: x = x * 4

# Division Assignment (/=): Divides the variable by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.
x /= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x / 2

# Modulus Assignment (%=): Computes the modulus of the variable and the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.
x %= 3  # Equivalent to: x = x % 3

# Floor Division Assignment (//=): Performs floor division on the variable and the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.
x //= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x // 2

# Exponentiation Assignment (**=): Raises the variable to the power of the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.
x **= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x ** 2
