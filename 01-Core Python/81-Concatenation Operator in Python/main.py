'''
In Python, the concatenation operator (+) allows you to concatenate (combine) two strings into a single string. It merges the contents of two strings together, creating a new string that contains the characters of both strings in the order they are specified. Here's how you can use the concatenation operator:
'''

string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"

# Using the concatenation operator to concatenate the two strings
concatenated_string = string1 + " " + string2

print(concatenated_string)  # Output: Hello World

'''In this example:

We have two strings, "Hello" and "World".
We use the concatenation operator (+) to concatenate these two strings together.
Additionally, we include a space " " between the strings to ensure there is a space between the words in the resulting concatenated string.
The resulting string "Hello World" is created by combining the contents of string1 and string2.

It's important to note that both operands of the concatenation operator must be strings. If you want to concatenate variables of other types (e.g., integers), you'll need to convert them to strings first using functions like str().'''
