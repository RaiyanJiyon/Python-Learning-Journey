Slicing a nested list in Python involves slicing both the outer list and the inner lists. You can use slicing notation to extract specific portions of the nested list based on the indices. Here's how you can slice a nested list:
'''

nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Slice the entire nested list
slice_1 = nested_list[:]

# Slice the first inner list
slice_2 = nested_list[0][:]

# Slice the first two elements of the second inner list
slice_3 = nested_list[1][:2]

# Slice the second and third elements of all inner lists
slice_4 = [inner_list[1:] for inner_list in nested_list]

print("Original Nested List:", nested_list)
print("Slice 1:", slice_1)
print("Slice 2:", slice_2)
print("Slice 3:", slice_3)
print("Slice 4:", slice_4)


'''
In this example:

nested_list[:] slices the entire nested list, creating a shallow copy.
nested_list[0][:] slices the first inner list, creating a shallow copy of it.
nested_list[1][:2] slices the first two elements of the second inner list.
[inner_list[1:] for inner_list in nested_list] slices the second and third elements of all inner lists using a list comprehension.
'''

'''You can customize the slicing indices according to your requirements to extract specific portions of the nested list. Keep in mind that slicing creates shallow copies of the nested lists, meaning that changes to the slices will not affect the original nested list, but changes to the elements within the slices may affect the original nested list.
