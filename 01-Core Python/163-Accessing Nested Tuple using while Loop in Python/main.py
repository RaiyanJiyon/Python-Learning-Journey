'''
To access elements of a nested tuple using a while loop in Python, you can use nested loops to iterate over each level of the nested structure. Here's how you can do it:
'''

nested_tuple = ((1, 2), ('a', 'b', 'c'), (True, False))

# Accessing elements of a nested tuple using a while loop
outer_index = 0
while outer_index < len(nested_tuple):
    inner_tuple = nested_tuple[outer_index]
    inner_index = 0
    while inner_index < len(inner_tuple):
        print(inner_tuple[inner_index])
        inner_index += 1
    outer_index += 1


'''
In this example:

We have a nested tuple nested_tuple containing three inner tuples.
We use a while loop to iterate over each inner tuple (inner_tuple) in the nested_tuple. The outer loop is controlled by the variable outer_index.
Within the outer loop, we use another while loop to iterate over each element of the current inner_tuple. The inner loop is controlled by the variable inner_index.
During each iteration, the variables outer_index and inner_index are used to access elements of the nested tuple.
Inside the inner loop, we print each element.
'''

'''This loop will iterate over each element of the nested tuple, printing each element in sequence. It's another way to access elements of a nested tuple using a while loop instead of a for loop.
