'''
In Python, keyword arguments are passed to a function with the parameter name followed by the value, allowing you to specify the arguments by their parameter names. Unlike positional arguments, which are matched to parameters based on their order, keyword arguments are matched to parameters based on their names. This provides more flexibility and clarity when calling functions, especially for functions with many parameters or when you want to specify only certain arguments.
'''

# Here's an example of using keyword arguments in a function call:
def greet(name, greeting):
    """This function greets the person with the given name using the provided greeting."""
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

# Calling the greet function with keyword arguments
greet(greeting="Hello", name="Alice")

'''In this example:

We call the greet() function with keyword arguments: greeting="Hello" and name="Alice".
The keyword arguments are matched to the corresponding parameters in the function definition based on their names, regardless of the order.
The function then prints "Hello, Alice!".
Keyword arguments offer several advantages:

They make function calls more self-explanatory by explicitly specifying the meaning of each argument.
They allow you to specify only the arguments you want to provide, leaving the others with their default values if they exist.
They provide more flexibility when calling functions with many parameters, as you can specify arguments in any order.
It's worth noting that you can use a mix of positional and keyword arguments in a function call. However, positional arguments must come before keyword arguments in the argument list.
