# Logical Operators in Python

In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate multiple conditions. These operators return Boolean values `(True or False)` based on the truth values of the operands involved. Here are the logical operators in Python along with examples of their usage:

```python
#Logical AND (and): Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise returns False.
result = (5 > 3) and (2 < 4)  # result will be True

# Logical OR (or): Returns True if at least one of the operands is True, otherwise returns False.
result = (5 > 3) or (2 < 1)  # result will be True

# Logical NOT (not): Returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.
result = not (5 > 3)  # result will be False
```

Logical operators are commonly used to combine multiple conditions in conditional statements `(if, elif, else)` and `loops` to control the flow of a program based on complex conditions. Understanding and using logical operators is essential for writing logical and efficient Python code.
