'''
Passing a set to a function in Python works similarly to passing other types of objects. You can simply include the set as an argument when calling the function, and the function can then access and manipulate the set as needed.

Here's an example demonstrating how to pass a set to a function:
'''

def process_set(input_set):
    # Perform some operations on the set
    for element in input_set:
        print(element)

# Define a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Call the function and pass the set as an argument
process_set(my_set)


'''
In this example:

We define a function process_set that takes a single argument input_set.
Inside the function, we iterate over the elements of the input set using a for loop and print each element.
We define a set my_set containing elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
We call the process_set function and pass my_set as an argument.
The function process_set receives the set as its input_set parameter and can perform operations on it as needed. You can pass sets of any size and containing any types of elements to functions in Python.
