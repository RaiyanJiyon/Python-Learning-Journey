'''
In Python, the insert() method is a built-in function used to insert an element at a specified position within a list.
'''

# Here's an example demonstrating how to use the insert() method:

# Define a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Insert an element at index 2
my_list.insert(2, 10)

print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5]

'''
In this example:

We have a list called my_list containing integers.
We use the insert() method to insert the value 10 at index 2.
After the insertion, the element 10 is placed at index 2, and the elements after index 2 are shifted to the right.
'''

'''It's important to note that the insert() method modifies the original list in place and does not return a new list. If you want to insert elements at the end of the list, you can simply use the append() method. However, if you want to insert elements at specific positions within the list, the insert() method is the appropriate choice.
