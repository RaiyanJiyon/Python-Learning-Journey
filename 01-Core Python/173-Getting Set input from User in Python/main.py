To get a set input from the user in Python, you can prompt the user to enter elements separated by spaces or any other delimiter, then split the input string into individual elements and convert them into a set using either a loop or using the set() constructor.

Here's a simple example:
'''

# Prompt the user to enter elements separated by spaces
user_input = input("Enter elements separated by spaces: ")

# Split the input string into individual elements
elements = user_input.split()

# Convert the list of elements into a set
user_set = set(elements)

# Print the set entered by the user
print("Set entered by the user:", user_set)


'''
When you run this code, it will prompt the user to enter elements separated by spaces. For example, the user could input 1 2 3 4 5. The program will then split the input string into individual elements (['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) and convert them into a set ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}). Finally, it will print the set entered by the user.

Keep in mind that this example assumes that the user enters elements separated by spaces. You can adjust the input prompt and splitting logic based on your specific requirements.
