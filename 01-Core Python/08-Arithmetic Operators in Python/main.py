In Python, arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. Here's a list of arithmetic operators in Python along with examples of their usage:

'''

#Addition (+): Adds two operands.
result = 5 + 3  # result will be 8

#Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
result = 5 - 3  # result will be 2

#Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
result = 5 * 3  # result will be 15

# Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second (returns a float).
result = 5 / 3  # result will be approximately 1.6666666666666667

#Floor Division (//): Divides the first operand by the second and returns the integer part of the result (rounded down).
result = 5 // 3  # result will be 1

#Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.
result = 5 % 3  # result will be 2

# Exponentiation (**): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
result = 5 ** 3  # result will be 125

# Python also supports the use of parentheses to control the order of operations, just like in standard mathematics.
result = (5 + 3) * 2  # result will be 16
