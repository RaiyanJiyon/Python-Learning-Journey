'''
In Python, you can return a list from a function just like you would return any other object. You can create and manipulate a list within the function, and then return it to the caller. Here's how you can return a list from a function:
'''

def create_list():
    new_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    return new_list

# Call the function and receive the returned list
result_list = create_list()

# Print the returned list
print("Returned List:", result_list)

'''
In this example:

We define a function create_list that creates a new list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
We use the return statement to return the new list from the function.
We call the create_list function and store the returned list in the variable result_list.
We print the returned list to verify its contents.
'''

'''You can manipulate the list and perform any necessary operations on it within the function before returning it. The returned list can be used by the caller of the function as needed.
