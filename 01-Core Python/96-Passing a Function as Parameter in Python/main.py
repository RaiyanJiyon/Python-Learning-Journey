'''
In Python, functions are first-class citizens, which means you can treat them like any other object. This includes passing functions as parameters to other functions. This is a powerful feature that allows you to write more flexible and reusable code.
'''

# Here's an example of passing a function as a parameter in Python:
def greet():
    """This function greets the user."""
    print("Hello!")

def call_function(func):
    """This function calls the given function."""
    print("Calling the function...")
    func()

# Passing the greet function as a parameter to call_function
call_function(greet)

'''
In this example:

We have a greet() function that prints "Hello!" when called.
We define another function call_function(func) that takes a function func as a parameter.
Inside call_function(), we print a message and then call the function passed as the parameter using func().
When we call call_function(greet), we are passing the greet() function as an argument. Inside call_function(), func() is called, which invokes the greet() function, resulting in "Hello!" being printed.

Passing functions as parameters is commonly used in scenarios where you want to abstract certain behavior into a separate function and then pass that function to another function that will execute it in a specific context. This allows for cleaner and more modular code and enables powerful programming paradigms like higher-order functions and callbacks.
