NumPy provides a wide range of built-in math functions that operate on arrays, enabling efficient numerical computations. These functions are optimized for performance and are designed to work seamlessly with NumPy arrays. Here are some commonly used math functions available in NumPy:

Element-wise functions:

np.sin(): Compute sine element-wise.
np.cos(): Compute cosine element-wise.
np.tan(): Compute tangent element-wise.
np.exp(): Compute the exponential of each element.
np.log(): Natural logarithm, element-wise.
np.log10(): Base-10 logarithm, element-wise.
np.sqrt(): Compute the non-negative square root of each element.
Trigonometric functions:

np.arcsin(): Inverse sine, element-wise.
np.arccos(): Inverse cosine, element-wise.
np.arctan(): Inverse tangent, element-wise.
np.arctan2(): Element-wise arc tangent of y / x.
np.hypot(): Given the "legs" of a right triangle, return its hypotenuse.
Hyperbolic functions:

np.sinh(): Hyperbolic sine, element-wise.
np.cosh(): Hyperbolic cosine, element-wise.
np.tanh(): Hyperbolic tangent, element-wise.
Rounding functions:

np.round(): Round elements of the array to the nearest integer.
np.floor(): Return the floor of the input, element-wise.
np.ceil(): Return the ceiling of the input, element-wise.
Other mathematical functions:

np.sum(): Sum of array elements over a given axis.
np.mean(): Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.
np.std(): Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis.
np.var(): Compute the variance along the specified axis.
np.min(): Return the minimum along a given axis.
np.max(): Return the maximum along a given axis.
np.sort(): Return a sorted copy of an array.
np.argsort(): Returns the indices that would sort an array.
These are just a few examples of the many math functions available in NumPy. NumPy's extensive library of mathematical functions makes it a powerful tool for scientific computing, data analysis, and numerical simulations.
