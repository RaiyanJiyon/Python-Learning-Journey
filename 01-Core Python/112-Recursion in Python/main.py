Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. In Python, as in many other programming languages, recursion is a powerful and elegant way to solve certain types of problems, especially those that exhibit a recursive structure.

# Here's a simple example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:  # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case: factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage
result = factorial(5)
print("Factorial of 5 is:", result)  # Output: 120

'''
In this example:

The factorial() function takes a non-negative integer n as input.
It has a base case that checks if n is equal to 0, in which case it returns 1. This is necessary to terminate the recursion.
If n is not 0, the function calls itself recursively with n - 1, multiplying the result by n.
The function keeps calling itself recursively until it reaches the base case, at which point it starts returning values up the call stack to compute the final result.

'''Recursion can be a very elegant and intuitive way to solve certain problems, especially those that can be naturally expressed in terms of smaller instances of the same problem. However, it's important to ensure that recursive functions have well-defined base cases and will eventually terminate, otherwise they can lead to infinite recursion and stack overflow errors.

Common examples of problems that are often solved using recursion include computing factorials, calculating Fibonacci numbers, traversing tree structures, and exploring permutations and combinations. However, not all problems are well-suited to recursion, and it's important to consider factors like performance and readability when choosing whether to use recursion or iteration to solve a particular problem.
