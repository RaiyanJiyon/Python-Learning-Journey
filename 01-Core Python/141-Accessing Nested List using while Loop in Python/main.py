Accessing elements of a nested list using a while loop involves a similar approach to using a for loop, but you would use index-based iteration instead. Here's how you can access elements of a nested list using a while loop:
'''

nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Accessing elements using a while loop
row_index = 0
while row_index < len(nested_list):
    column_index = 0
    while column_index < len(nested_list[row_index]):
        print(nested_list[row_index][column_index], end=" ")
        column_index += 1
    print()  # Print newline after each row
    row_index += 1

'''
In this example:

We initialize row_index to 0 and use it to index the outer list (nested_list) to iterate over each inner list.
Within the outer loop, we initialize column_index to 0 and use it to index the current inner list to iterate over each element.
We print each element using nested_list[row_index][column_index].
After printing all elements of an inner list, we print a newline to move to the next line for the next inner list.
We increment both row_index and column_index in each iteration to move to the next row and column, respectively.
'''

'''This while loop structure allows you to access and process each element of the nested list individually, similar to the for loop approach. However, you need to manage index-based iteration manually, which may require more code compared to using a for loop.
