# Bitwise Operator in Python

In Python, bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. These operators treat the operands as sequences of binary digits and operate on each pair of corresponding bits. Here are the bitwise operators in Python along with examples of their usage:

## Bitwise AND (&): 
Performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding bits of two operands.

```python
result = 5 & 3  # result will be 1
```

## Bitwise OR (|): 
Performs a bitwise OR operation between corresponding bits of two operands.

```python
result = 5 | 3  # result will be 7
```

## Bitwise XOR (^): 
Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between corresponding bits of two operands.

```python
result = 5 ^ 3  # result will be 6
```

## Bitwise NOT (~): 
Performs a bitwise inversion, flipping all the bits of the operand.

```python
result = ~5  # result will be -6
```

## Bitwise Left Shift (<<): 
Shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the second operand.

```python
result = 5 << 1  # result will be 10
```

## Bitwise Right Shift (>>): 
Shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand.

```python
result = 5 >> 1  # result will be 2
```
