# Break Statement and Continue Statement in Python

In Python, the break and continue statements are used to alter the flow of control within loops (for and while loops).

## break statement:
The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely based on a certain condition.

When encountered, the break statement immediately terminates the innermost loop it is contained in, and control is passed to the next statement following the loop.
It allows you to "break out" of the loop prematurely, without completing all iterations.

### Example of using break statement:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exit loop when i equals 5
    print(i)
```

## continue statement:

The continue statement is used to skip the remaining code within the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration.

When encountered, the continue statement skips the remaining statements in the loop's block and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
It allows you to skip certain iterations of the loop based on a condition.

### Example of using continue statement:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)
```

In both examples, the loop iterates over numbers from 0 to 9. However, the break statement in the first example terminates the loop when i equals 5, while the continue statement in the second example skips even numbers, printing only odd numbers.

Both break and continue statements can be used in for loops and while loops to modify the flow of control. They provide flexibility in controlling the behavior of loops based on certain conditions.
