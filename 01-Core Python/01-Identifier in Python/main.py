'''
In Python, an identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other object. Identifiers must follow certain rules:

They can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores.
They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
They cannot start with a digit (0-9).
Python keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

# Here are some examples of valid identifiers:
my_variable = 10
my_function = lambda x: x**2
# MyClass = MyClass()
_underscore_variable = 42

# And here are examples of invalid identifiers:
'''
2variable = 10  # Starts with a digit
for = 5         # Uses a Python keyword as an identifier
my-variable = 3 # Contains a hyphen
