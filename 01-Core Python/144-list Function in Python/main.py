'''
In Python, the list() function is a built-in function used to create a new list object. It can convert an iterable object (such as a string, tuple, range, or another list) into a list. The syntax for the list() function is as follows:
'''

# list(iterable)

'''
Where iterable is the object that you want to convert into a list.

Here are some examples of using the list() function:
'''

# Converting a string to a list of characters:
string = "hello"
char_list = list(string)
print(char_list)  # Output: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']


# Converting a tuple to a list:
tuple_data = (1, 2, 3)
list_data = list(tuple_data)
print(list_data)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]


# Converting a range object to a list:
range_data = range(5)
list_data = list(range_data)
print(list_data)  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


# Converting another list to a new list (creating a shallow copy):
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = list(original_list)
print(new_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

'''
It's important to note that the list() function creates a new list object, even when the input iterable is already a list. If you want to create a shallow copy of an existing list, you can use the copy() method or the slicing technique [ : ]
