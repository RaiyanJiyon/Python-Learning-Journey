'''
To get a list input from the user in Python, you can use input() function to receive a string of comma-separated values, and then split this string to create a list. Here's how you can do it:
'''

# Get input from the user as a string of comma-separated values
values_str = input("Enter elements separated by commas: ")

# Split the string to create a list of values
values_list = values_str.split(',')

# Convert each string element in the list to its respective data type if needed
# For example, if you want to convert all elements to integers:
# values_list = [int(value) for value in values_list]

# Print the resulting list
print("List:", values_list)


'''
Here's how it works:

The input() function is used to receive a string input from the user. The user can input elements separated by commas.
We use the split() method to split the string based on commas. This creates a list of string elements.
If you need to convert the elements to a specific data type (e.g., integers), you can do so by using list comprehension or loops to iterate over the list and apply the conversion function.
Finally, the resulting list is printed.

For example, if the user inputs "1,2,3,4,5", the resulting list will be ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']. If you need the elements as integers, you can convert them accordingly.

If you want to receive a list of integers directly from the user, you can modify the code like this:
'''

# Get input from the user as a string of comma-separated values
values_str = input("Enter elements separated by commas: ")

# Split the string to create a list of values
values_list = [int(value) for value in values_str.split(',')]

# Print the resulting list
print("List:", values_list)


'''This will directly create a list of integers. Keep in mind that this approach assumes the user will provide input in the correct format. You might want to add error handling to handle cases where the input format is incorrect.'''
