# Immediately Invoked Function Expression in Python

An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a common pattern in JavaScript where a function is executed immediately after it is defined. Although Python does not have native support for IIFEs like JavaScript, you can achieve similar behavior using lambda functions or regular function definitions.

### Using Lambda Functions

You can create and immediately invoke a lambda function in Python:

```python
result = (lambda x, y: x + y)(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example:
- The lambda function `lambda x, y: x + y` is defined and immediately invoked with the arguments `3` and `5`.
- The result of the lambda function, which is `8`, is assigned to `result`.

### Using Regular Functions

You can also use regular functions and invoke them immediately:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

Although this is not as concise as using a lambda, it is more readable for more complex logic.

### Using Nested Functions

If you want to encapsulate the function definition and invocation in a single expression, you can use a nested function approach:

```python
result = (lambda x, y: (lambda a, b: a + b)(x, y))(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example:
- An outer lambda function `lambda x, y` is defined, which in turn defines and invokes an inner lambda function `lambda a, b: a + b`.
- The outer lambda function is immediately invoked with `3` and `5`, which are passed to the inner lambda function.

### Practical Use Case: IIFE in Python

A practical use case for an IIFE-like pattern in Python is when you want to initialize a value or run some setup code without polluting the global namespace:

```python
# IIFE-like pattern to create an isolated scope
result = (lambda: (a + b) for a, b in [(3, 5)])().__next__()
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example:
- The lambda function returns a generator expression that calculates `a + b` for the tuple `(3, 5)`.
- The generator is immediately invoked with `().__next__()` to get the result.

### Conclusion

While Python does not have a built-in syntax for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) like JavaScript, you can achieve similar behavior using lambda functions or regular functions. This approach can be useful for creating isolated scopes or for immediately executing short-lived code. However, for more complex logic, regular functions with immediate invocation are usually more readable and maintainable.
