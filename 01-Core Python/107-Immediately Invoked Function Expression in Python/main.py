'''
In Python, you can achieve the equivalent of an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) by simply defining a function and immediately calling it. While Python doesn't have a built-in syntax specifically for IIFEs like some other languages (e.g., JavaScript), the concept can be replicated easily.
'''


# Here's how you can create and execute an IIFE in Python:

# Define and call the IIFE
(lambda x: print(x))(10)  # Output: 10

'''
In this example:

We define an anonymous lambda function (lambda x: print(x)).
Immediately after defining the lambda function, we call it by providing the argument 10.
The lambda function is executed with the argument 10, and it prints 10 to the console.
'''

# Alternatively, you can use a regular named function for more complex IIFEs:

# Define a function and immediately call it
def my_iife(x):
    print(x)

my_iife(10)  # Output: 10


'''In this example, the function my_iife is defined and immediately called with the argument 10.

IIFEs in Python are typically used in situations where you need to perform some initialization tasks or create a temporary scope without polluting the global namespace. While not as common in Python as in JavaScript, they can still be useful in certain scenarios, especially when you want to encapsulate functionality in a single expression.'''
