'''
Certainly! Here's an example demonstrating the usage of if, elif, and else statements together in Python:
'''

x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")

'''
Explanation:

The if statement checks if x is greater than 0. If the condition is true, it executes the code block and prints "x is positive".
If the condition in the if statement is false, the elif (else if) statement is evaluated. It checks if x is equal to 0. If true, it executes the code block and prints "x is zero".
If both the conditions in the if and elif statements are false, the else statement is executed. It executes the code block and prints "x is negative".
