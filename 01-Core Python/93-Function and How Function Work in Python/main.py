'''
In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions provide modularity and code reusability by allowing you to encapsulate a sequence of statements into a single unit. You can define functions to perform tasks and then call them whenever needed throughout your program.
'''

# Here's a simple example of a Python function:
def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person with the given name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling the function
greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!

'''
In this example:

We define a function named greet using the def keyword.
The function takes one parameter named name.
Inside the function, we use the print() function to print a greeting message using the provided name.
The docstring ("""This function greets the person with the given name.""") provides a description of what the function does.
We call the function by passing an argument ("Alice") to it.

'''Functions play a crucial role in structuring Python programs, promoting code reuse, and enhancing readability and maintainability. You can define your own functions or use built-in functions provided by Python or external libraries to accomplish various tasks efficiently.'''
