'''
In Python, the repetition operator (*) allows you to create a new string by repeating an existing string multiple times. This operator can be useful when you need to concatenate multiple copies of a string together. Here's how you can use the repetition operator:
'''

my_string = "Hello"

# Using the repetition operator to repeat the string three times
repeated_string = my_string * 3

print(repeated_string)  # Output: HelloHelloHello

'''In this example, the string "Hello" is repeated three times using the repetition operator (*). The resulting string "HelloHelloHello" is created by concatenating three copies of the original string "Hello" together.

It's important to note that the operand on the left side of the repetition operator must be a string, and the operand on the right side must be an integer specifying the number of repetitions. The resulting string will contain the original string repeated the specified number of times.'''
