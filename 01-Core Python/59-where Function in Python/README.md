# where Function in Python

The `numpy.where()` function in Python is used to return the indices of elements in an input array where a given condition is satisfied. It is particularly useful for selecting elements from an array based on some condition. The syntax of the numpy.where() function is as follows:

```
numpy.where(condition[, x, y])
```

`condition`: The condition that specifies which elements to select. It can be a boolean array or an expression that evaluates to a boolean array.

`x` (optional): Values to be used where the condition is True.

`y` (optional): Values to be used where the condition is False.

If x and y are not provided, numpy.where() returns a tuple of arrays containing the indices where the condition is True.

### Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage of numpy.where():

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Using only the condition argument
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices = np.where(arr > 2)
print(indices)  # Output: (array([2, 3, 4]),)

# Example 2: Using all arguments
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = np.where(arr > 2, 'greater', 'lesser or equal')
print(result)  # Output: ['lesser or equal' 'lesser or equal' 'greater' 'greater' 'greater']
```

In the first example,
- numpy.where() returns a tuple containing the indices where the condition arr > 2 is True. 
- In this case, elements at indices 2, 3, and 4 satisfy the condition.

In the second example,
 
 - numpy.where() is used with all three arguments. 
 - The first argument is the condition, the second argument specifies the value to be used where the condition is True, and the third argument specifies the value to be used where the condition is False. 
 - In this case, 'greater' is returned where the condition is True, and 'lesser or equal' is returned where the condition is False.
