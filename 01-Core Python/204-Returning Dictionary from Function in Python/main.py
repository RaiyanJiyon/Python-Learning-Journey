'''
You can return a dictionary from a function in Python by constructing or modifying a dictionary within the function and using the return statement to pass it back to the caller. Here's a simple example:
'''

# Define a function that constructs and returns a dictionary
def create_dictionary():
    my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
    return my_dict

# Call the function and store the returned dictionary
result_dict = create_dictionary()

# Print the returned dictionary
print("Returned dictionary:", result_dict)


'''
In this example:

The create_dictionary() function constructs a dictionary my_dict with some predefined key-value pairs.
The function returns this dictionary using the return statement.
When the function is called and the result is assigned to result_dict, it holds the returned dictionary.
Finally, we print the returned dictionary.
You can modify the function to construct the dictionary dynamically based on parameters or data within the function, allowing for more flexible dictionary creation and manipulation.
