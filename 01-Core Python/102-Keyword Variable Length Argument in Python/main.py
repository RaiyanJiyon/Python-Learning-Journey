'''
In Python, you can define functions that accept a variable number of keyword arguments using the double asterisks ** syntax, often referred to as "keyword variable-length arguments" or "**kwargs". This allows you to pass an arbitrary number of keyword arguments to a function, which are then collected into a dictionary within the function.
'''


# Here's how you can define a function with keyword variable-length arguments:
def my_function(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Call the function with multiple keyword arguments
my_function(name="Alice", age=30, city="New York")  
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 30
# city: New York


'''
In this example, the function my_function accepts a variable number of keyword arguments, which are collected into the kwargs dictionary. Inside the function, we iterate over the kwargs dictionary and print each key-value pair.

'''Keyword variable-length arguments are especially useful when you want to create functions with a flexible interface that can accept additional named parameters. They provide a convenient way to handle optional arguments and allow for greater flexibility and customization in function calls.'''
