# Returning Lambda Function from a Function in Python

In Python, you can return a lambda function from another function. This technique is useful for creating higher-order functions, where a function returns another function as its result. This approach is often used to create function factories, currying, or for deferred execution.

### Example of Returning a Lambda Function

Let's consider an example where a function returns a lambda function that adds a specified value to its argument:

```python
def make_adder(n):
    """Function to create an adder lambda function."""
    return lambda x: x + n

# Create a function that adds 5 to its argument
add_five = make_adder(5)

# Use the returned lambda function
result = add_five(10)
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 15
```

#### Explanation:

- `make_adder(n)` is a function that takes an argument `n` and returns a lambda function `lambda x: x + n`.
- The returned lambda function takes one argument `x` and adds `n` to it.
- `add_five` is assigned the result of `make_adder(5)`, which is a lambda function that adds 5 to its argument.
- Calling `add_five(10)` returns 15 because the lambda function adds 5 to 10.

### Use Cases for Returning Lambda Functions

1. **Function Factories**: Functions that create and return other functions based on provided parameters.
  
2. **Currying**: Transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.

3. **Deferred Execution**: Creating functions that encapsulate certain behaviors to be executed later.

### Example of Function Factory

A function factory can create customized functions based on given parameters:

```python
def power_factory(exponent):
    """Function to create a power lambda function."""
    return lambda base: base ** exponent

# Create a square function
square = power_factory(2)

# Create a cube function
cube = power_factory(3)

# Use the returned lambda functions
print("Square of 4:", square(4))  # Output: Square of 4: 16
print("Cube of 3:", cube(3))      # Output: Cube of 3: 27
```

#### Explanation:

- `power_factory(exponent)` takes an argument `exponent` and returns a lambda function `lambda base: base ** exponent`.
- `square` is assigned the result of `power_factory(2)`, which is a lambda function that squares its argument.
- `cube` is assigned the result of `power_factory(3)`, which is a lambda function that cubes its argument.
- The returned lambda functions are then used to compute the square and cube of numbers.

### Example of Currying

Currying transforms a multi-argument function into a series of single-argument functions:

```python
def curried_adder(a):
    """Curried adder function."""
    return lambda b: lambda c: a + b + c

# Create a function chain
add_two = curried_adder(2)
add_two_and_three = add_two(3)

# Use the returned lambda function
result = add_two_and_three(4)
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 9
```

#### Explanation:

- `curried_adder(a)` returns a lambda function `lambda b: lambda c: a + b + c`.
- `add_two` is assigned the result of `curried_adder(2)`, which is a lambda function that takes `b` and returns another lambda function.
- `add_two_and_three` is assigned the result of `add_two(3)`, which is a lambda function that takes `c` and returns the sum of 2, 3, and `c`.
- Calling `add_two_and_three(4)` returns 9 because the lambda functions add 2, 3, and 4.

### Conclusion

Returning lambda functions from functions in Python provides a powerful way to create higher-order functions, function factories, and currying. This approach enhances the flexibility and expressiveness of your code, allowing you to encapsulate and reuse behavior dynamically. Understanding how to return and use lambda functions effectively can significantly improve your functional programming skills in Python.
