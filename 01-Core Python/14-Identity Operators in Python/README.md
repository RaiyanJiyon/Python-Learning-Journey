# Identify Operators in Python

In Python, identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects to determine whether they are the same object or not. These operators return Boolean values `(True or False)` based on the identity relationship between the operands. Here are the identity operators in Python along with examples of their usage:

## is: 
Evaluates to `True` if the operands refer to the same object in memory.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
result = x is y  # result will be False because x and y refer to different objects
```

## is not: 
Evaluates to `True` if the operands do not refer to the same object in memory.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
result = x is not y  # result will be True because x and y refer to different objects
```

Identity operators are used to compare the object identity rather than the object values. They are typically used when you need to check whether two variables refer to the same object in memory, especially when dealing with mutable objects like `lists`, `sets`, or `dictionaries`. Understanding and using identity operators can help ensure correct behavior in your Python programs.
