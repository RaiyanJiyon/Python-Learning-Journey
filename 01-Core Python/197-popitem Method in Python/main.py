'''
In Python, the popitem() method is used to remove and return an arbitrary (key, value) pair from the dictionary. This method is useful when you want to remove an item from the dictionary but you don't care about which item is removed, as dictionaries in Python do not maintain any specific order.

The syntax for the popitem() method is simply:
'''

my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Remove and return an arbitrary (key, value) pair
item = my_dict.popitem()
print("Removed item:", item)  # Output: Removed item: ('city', 'New York')

print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}


'''
In this example:

We call the popitem() method on the dictionary my_dict.
The method removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair from the dictionary. In this case, it removes and returns ('city', 'New York').
The removed item is printed, and you can see that it's in the form of a tuple (key, value).
After the popitem() operation, the dictionary is modified accordingly. Note that which item is removed is arbitrary and may vary between different Python implementations or versions.
