'''
Aliasing an array in Python refers to creating a new reference to an existing array. In other words, aliasing allows you to have multiple names (or references) for the same array in memory. When you modify the array through one name, the changes are reflected when accessing the array through the other name because they both refer to the same array object.
'''

# Here's an example of aliasing an array in Python:
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Alias the array
arr2 = arr1

# Modify the array through one alias
arr2[0] = 10

# Access the array through the other alias
print(arr1)  # Output: [10  2  3  4  5]

'''
In this example:

We create an array arr1 containing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
We alias the array by assigning arr1 to arr2. Now both arr1 and arr2 refer to the same array object in memory.
We modify the first element of the array through the arr2 alias by setting it to 10.
When we print arr1, we see that the change made through arr2 is reflected in arr1. This demonstrates that both arr1 and arr2 are aliases for the same array object.

'''Aliasing can be useful for avoiding unnecessary copying of large arrays in memory. However, it's important to be aware of aliasing when modifying arrays to avoid unintended side effects in your code.'''
