'''
In Python, you can find the length of a string using the len() function. The len() function returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters. Here's how you can use it:
'''

my_string = "Hello, World!"
length = len(my_string)
print("Length of the string:", length)

'''In this example, the length of the string "Hello, World!" is 13 characters. The len() function takes the string as an argument and returns its length as an integer value.'''
