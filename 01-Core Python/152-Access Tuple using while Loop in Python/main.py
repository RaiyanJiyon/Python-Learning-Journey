'''
You can access elements of a tuple using a while loop in Python by iterating over the indices of the tuple. Here's how you can do it:
'''

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'hello')

# Initialize index
index = 0

# Accessing elements of a tuple using a while loop
while index < len(my_tuple):
    print(my_tuple[index])
    index += 1

'''
In this example:

We have a tuple my_tuple containing elements (1, 2, 3, 'hello').
We initialize the index variable to 0 to start accessing elements from the beginning of the tuple.
We use a while loop with the condition index < len(my_tuple) to iterate until the index reaches the length of the tuple.
Inside the loop, we print the element of the tuple at the current index using my_tuple[index].
After printing each element, we increment the index by 1 to move to the next element in the tuple.

This loop iterates over each element of the tuple by incrementing the index until it reaches the end of the tuple. It's an alternative way to access elements of a tuple compared to using a for loop.
