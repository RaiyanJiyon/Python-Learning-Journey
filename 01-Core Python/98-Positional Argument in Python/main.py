'''
In Python, positional arguments are the most basic type of arguments passed to a function. When you call a function with positional arguments, the arguments are matched to the parameters in the function definition based on their positions, in the order they are passed. The first positional argument is matched to the first parameter, the second positional argument to the second parameter, and so on.
'''

# Here's an example of using positional arguments in a function call:
def greet(name, greeting):
    """This function greets the person with the given name using the provided greeting."""
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

# Calling the greet function with positional arguments
greet("Alice", "Hello")

'''
In this example:

The greet() function expects two positional arguments: name and greeting.
When we call the function greet("Alice", "Hello"), "Alice" is matched to the parameter name, and "Hello" is matched to the parameter greeting.
The function then prints "Hello, Alice!".

'''Positional arguments are simple and intuitive to use, but it's essential to pass them in the correct order according to the function definition. If you mix up the order, the function may not behave as expected, or you may encounter errors.'''
