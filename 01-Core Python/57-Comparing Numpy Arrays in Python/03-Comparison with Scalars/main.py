Comparison with Scalars:
You can compare elements of an array with a scalar value using comparison operators. The result is a boolean array indicating whether the condition is true for each element.

import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Comparison with a scalar
result_comparison_scalar = arr > 1

print("Comparison with Scalar:")
print(result_comparison_scalar)  # Output: [False  True  True]

'''These are some common methods for comparing NumPy arrays in Python. Depending on your specific needs, you can choose the appropriate method for your comparison task.'''
