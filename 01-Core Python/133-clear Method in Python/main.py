'''
In Python, the clear() method is a built-in function used to remove all elements from a list. It modifies the original list by removing all its elements, leaving it empty. The syntax for using the clear() method is as follows:'''

# list_name.clear()
'''
Where:

list_name is the name of the list that you want to clear.
'''

# Here's an example demonstrating how to use the clear() method:
# Define a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Clear the elements of the list
my_list.clear()

print("Cleared List:", my_list)  # Output: Cleared List: []

'''
In this example:

We have a list called my_list containing integers.
We use the clear() method to remove all elements from the list.
After clearing, the list becomes empty [].

'''It's important to note that the clear() method modifies the original list in place and does not return any value. Therefore, you don't need to assign the result of the clear() method to a new variable.
