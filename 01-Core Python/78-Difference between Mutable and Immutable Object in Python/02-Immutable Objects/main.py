Immutable Objects:
Immutable objects are objects whose state or content cannot be changed after they are created.
This means that once an immutable object is created, its internal state or contents cannot be modified.
Examples of immutable objects in Python include integers, floats, strings, tuples, and frozensets.
Immutable objects cannot be modified in-place; any operation that appears to modify them actually creates a new object.

# Example of immutable objects:
my_string = "Hello"
new_string = my_string + ", World!"  # Creating a new string
print(new_string)  # Output: Hello, World!

'''Key Differences:
Mutable objects can be modified in place, while immutable objects cannot be modified in place.
Immutable objects guarantee data integrity and thread safety because their state cannot be changed after creation.
Mutable objects are generally more memory-intensive than immutable objects because they support in-place modifications.

Understanding the mutability of objects is important for writing efficient and bug-free Python code. It helps in choosing the appropriate data structure and understanding the behavior of various operations on objects.'''
