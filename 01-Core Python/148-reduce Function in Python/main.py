'''
The reduce() function was a built-in function in Python 2's functools module. However, it was moved to the functools module in Python 3, so you need to import it explicitly.

reduce() is used to apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.

Here's the syntax:
'''

# functools.reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])

'''
function: This is a function of two arguments. It takes two arguments and returns a single value.
iterable: This is the iterable to be reduced.
initializer (optional): This is the initial value of the accumulator. If it's not provided, the first element of the iterable will be used as the initial value.
'''

# Here's an example of how you can use reduce():
from functools import reduce

# Define a function to add two numbers
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Define an iterable
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use reduce() to compute the sum of the numbers
sum_of_numbers = reduce(add, numbers)

print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)

'''
In this example:

We import the reduce() function from the functools module.
We define a function add(x, y) that adds two numbers.
We have a list numbers containing integers from 1 to 5.
We use the reduce() function to apply the add() function cumulatively to the elements of the numbers list, computing the sum of all the numbers.

'''Keep in mind that reduce() is not as commonly used in Python as map() and filter(), and it may not be as readable in certain cases. In many situations, using a for loop or list comprehension may be clearer and more Pythonic.
