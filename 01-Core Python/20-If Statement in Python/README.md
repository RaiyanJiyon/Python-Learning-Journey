# If Statement in Python

In Python, the if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. It allows you to perform conditional execution based on the evaluation of an expression. Here's the syntax of the if statement:

```
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is True
    statement1
    statement2
    # More statements
```

### Here's how you declare and initialize if Statement in Python:

```python
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
if x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
```
