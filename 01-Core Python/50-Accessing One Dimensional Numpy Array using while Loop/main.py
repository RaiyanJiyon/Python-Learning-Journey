'''
You can access elements of a one-dimensional NumPy array using a while loop by iterating over the indices of the array. Here's how you can do it:
'''

import numpy as np

# Create a one-dimensional NumPy array
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Get the length of the array
array_length = len(my_array)

# Initialize an index variable
index = 0

# Access elements of the array using a while loop
while index < array_length:
    print(my_array[index])
    index += 1

'''In this example:

We first import the NumPy library as np.
We create a one-dimensional NumPy array named my_array.
We determine the length of the array using the len() function and store it in the variable array_length.
We initialize an index variable named index to 0.
Inside the while loop, we access each element of the array using indexing (my_array[index]) and print it.
After printing each element, we increment the index variable by 1.
The loop continues until the index variable becomes equal to the length of the array.
This loop iterates over each element of the array and prints it using a while loop. It provides an alternative method for accessing array elements compared to using a for loop.'''
