# Build in Data Types in Python

Python comes with several built-in data types, which are fundamental to programming in Python. These data types are used to represent different kinds of values. Here's an overview of the most common built-in data types in Python:

## Numeric Types:
- `int`: Integer numbers, e.g., 5, -3, 1000.
- `float`: Floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 2.0.

## Boolean Type:
- `bool`: Represents the truth values True or False.

## Sequence Types:
- `str`: Represents strings of characters, e.g., "hello", 'world'.
- `list`: Ordered collection of items, mutable, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'].
- `tuple`: Ordered collection of items, immutable, e.g., (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c').
- `range`: Represents a range of numbers, e.g., range(5) represents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

## Mapping Type:
- `dict`: Collection of key-value pairs, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}.

## Set Types:
- `set`: Unordered collection of unique items, e.g., {1, 2, 3}.
- `frozenset`: Immutable version of a set.

## None Type:
- `NoneType`: Represents the absence of a value, usually used to indicate that a variable doesn't refer to anything, e.g., None.

These built-in data types are versatile and can be used to represent a wide range of data in Python programs. Understanding how to use and manipulate these data types is essential for writing effective Python code.
