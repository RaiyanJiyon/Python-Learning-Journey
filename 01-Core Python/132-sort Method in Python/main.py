'''
In Python, the sort() method is a built-in function used to sort the elements of a list in place. It modifies the original list by rearranging its elements in ascending order by default, or in the specified order using optional parameters. The syntax for using the sort() method is as follows:
'''

# list_name.sort(reverse=False, key=None)

'''
Where:

list_name is the name of the list that you want to sort.
reverse (optional) is a boolean value indicating whether to sort the list in descending order (reverse=True) or ascending order (reverse=False). By default, reverse=False.
key (optional) is a function that specifies a custom key for sorting. It is used to extract a comparison key from each element before sorting.
'''

# Here's an example demonstrating how to use the sort() method:
# Define a list
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]

# Sort the elements of the list in ascending order
my_list.sort()

print("Sorted List (ascending):", my_list)  # Output: Sorted List (ascending): [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]

# Sort the elements of the list in descending order
my_list.sort(reverse=True)

print("Sorted List (descending):", my_list)  # Output: Sorted List (descending): [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]


'''
In this example:

We have a list called my_list containing integers.
We use the sort() method to sort the elements of the list. By default, it sorts the list in ascending order.
After sorting, the list is modified to [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9].
We then use the sort(reverse=True) to sort the list in descending order.
After sorting in descending order, the list becomes [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1].

'''It's important to note that the sort() method modifies the original list in place and does not return any value. Therefore, you don't need to assign the result of the sort() method to a new variable. If you want to sort a list without modifying the original list, you can use the sorted() function instead.
