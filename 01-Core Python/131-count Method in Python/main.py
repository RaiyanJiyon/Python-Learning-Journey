'''
In Python, the count() method is a built-in function used to count the number of occurrences of a specified value in a list. It returns the number of times the specified value appears in the list. The syntax for using the count() method is as follows:
'''

# count = list_name.count(value)
'''
Where:

list_name is the name of the list in which you want to count occurrences.
value is the value for which you want to count occurrences.
count is the number of occurrences of the specified value in the list.
'''

# Here's an example demonstrating how to use the count() method

# Define a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]

# Count the number of occurrences of the value 2 in the list
count = my_list.count(2)

print("Count:", count)  # Output: Count: 3

'''
In this example:

We have a list called my_list containing integers.
We use the count() method to count the number of occurrences of the value 2 in the list.
The value 3 is assigned to the variable count, indicating that the value 2 appears three times in the list.
'''

# The count() method returns zero if the specified value is not found in the list:

# Count the number of occurrences of a value that does not exist in the list
count = my_list.count(6)

print("Count:", count)  # Output: Count: 0

'''The count() method only counts occurrences of the specified value and does not modify the original list.'''
