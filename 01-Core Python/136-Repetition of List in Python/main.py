'''
In Python, you can create a new list by repeating the elements of an existing list using the repetition operator *. This operator allows you to create a new list with multiple copies of the elements from the original list. Here's how you can repeat a list:
'''

original_list = [1, 2, 3]

repeated_list = original_list * 3  # Repeat original_list three times

print(repeated_list)

'''
In this example, original_list contains the elements [1, 2, 3]. By using the repetition operator * with a factor of 3, we create a new list repeated_list that contains three repetitions of the elements from original_list.
'''

'''Keep in mind that the repetition operator creates a new list with the repeated elements and does not modify the original list. If you need to repeat a list a specific number of times, this method is handy.
