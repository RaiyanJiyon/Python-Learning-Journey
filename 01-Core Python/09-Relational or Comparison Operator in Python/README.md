# Relational or Comparison Operator in Python

In Python, relational or comparison operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean value `(True or False)` based on whether the comparison is true or false. Here are the relational operators in Python along with examples of their usage:

## Equal to (==):
 Checks if the values of two operands are equal.

```python
result = 5 == 3  # result will be False
```
## Not equal to (!=): 
Checks if the values of two operands are not equal.

```python
result = 5 != 3  # result will be True
```

## Greater than (>): 
Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand.

```python
result = 5 > 3  # result will be True
```

## Less than (<): 
Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand.

```python
result = 5 < 3  # result will be False
```

## Greater than or equal to (>=): 
Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand.

```python
result = 5 >= 3  # result will be True
```

## Less than or equal to (<=):
Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand.

```python
result = 5 <= 3  # result will be False
```

Relational operators are commonly used in conditional statements `(if, elif, else)` and `loops` to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. Understanding and using these operators is essential for writing logical and efficient Python code.
