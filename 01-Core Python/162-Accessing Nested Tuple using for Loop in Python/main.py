'''
To access elements of a nested tuple using a for loop in Python, you can use nested loops to iterate over each level of the nested structure. Here's how you can do it:
'''

nested_tuple = ((1, 2), ('a', 'b', 'c'), (True, False))

# Accessing elements of a nested tuple using a for loop
for inner_tuple in nested_tuple:
    for element in inner_tuple:
        print(element)

'''
In this example:

We have a nested tuple nested_tuple containing three inner tuples.
We use a for loop to iterate over each inner tuple (inner_tuple) in the nested_tuple.
Within the nested loop, we use another for loop to iterate over each element (element) in the current inner_tuple.
During each iteration, the variable element takes on the value of each element in the nested tuple, one at a time.
Inside the nested loop, we print each element.
'''

'''This loop will iterate over each element of the nested tuple, printing each element in sequence. It's a convenient way to access elements of a nested tuple without needing to manually index each element.
