# pop Method in Python

In Python, the `pop()` method is used to remove and return the element at a specified index from a list. It modifies the original list in place. The syntax for using the `pop()` method is:

```
element = list_name.pop(index)
```

`list_name`: The name of the list from which you want to remove an element.

`index`: The index of the element you want to remove. If not specified, the last element of the list is removed by default.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of the `pop()` method:


```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Remove and return the element at index 2
element = my_list.pop(2)
print("Removed element:", element)  # Output: Removed element: 3
print("Modified list:", my_list)    # Output: Modified list: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

In this example:

- We have a list named my_list containing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- We use the pop() method to remove and return the element at index 2, which is 3.
- After removing 3, the list becomes [1, 2, 4, 5].
- The removed element 3 is assigned to the variable element.

```python
# If the index parameter is not specified, the pop() method removes and returns the last element of the list:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Remove and return the last element
element = my_list.pop()
print("Removed element:", element)  # Output: Removed element: 5
print("Modified list:", my_list)    # Output: Modified list: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The `pop()` method allows you to efficiently remove elements from a list based on their index, and it also provides a way to retrieve the removed element if needed.
