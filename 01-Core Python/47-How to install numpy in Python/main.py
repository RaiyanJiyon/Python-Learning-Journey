To install NumPy in Python, you can use pip, the package manager for Python. Here's how to do it:

Open your command-line interface (CLI). This could be Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux.

Type the following command and press Enter:
'''

# pip install numpy

'''
Pip will then download and install NumPy and its dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that NumPy is installed by opening a Python interpreter and typing:
'''

import numpy
'''If no errors occur, NumPy is successfully installed and ready to use.

That's it! You have now installed NumPy in Python. You can start using it in your projects for numerical computations and array operations.'''
