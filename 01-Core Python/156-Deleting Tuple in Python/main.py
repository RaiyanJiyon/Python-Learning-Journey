'''
In Python, you cannot directly delete individual elements from a tuple because tuples are immutable. However, you can delete the entire tuple object itself using the del statement. Once a tuple is deleted, you cannot access its elements anymore.

Here's how you can delete a tuple:
'''

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Delete the entire tuple
del my_tuple

# Attempt to access the tuple after deletion
print(my_tuple)  # This will raise a NameError


# Output
# NameError: name 'my_tuple' is not defined

'''
In this example:

We define a tuple my_tuple containing elements (1, 2, 3).
We use the del statement to delete the entire tuple.
After deletion, attempting to access my_tuple raises a NameError because the tuple no longer exists.
It's important to note that once you delete a tuple, it cannot be recovered, and any references to the tuple will result in errors. Therefore, use the del statement carefully when deleting tuples or any other objects in Python.
