'''
In Python, the id(), type(), and sys.getsizeof() functions are used to obtain information about objects and their memory usage:

id() Function:

The id() function returns the unique identifier (memory address) of an object.

It is useful for determining if two variables reference the same object in memory.

Syntax: id(object)

Example:
'''

x = 42
y = 42
print(id(x))  # Output: Memory address of x
print(id(y))  # Output: Memory address of y (same as x)


'''
type() Function:

The type() function returns the type of an object.

It is useful for checking the type of an object at runtime.

Syntax: type(object)

Example:
'''

x = 42
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>


'''
sys.getsizeof() Function:

The sys.getsizeof() function returns the size of an object in bytes.

It is useful for analyzing the memory footprint of objects, especially for large data structures.

Note that this function is part of the sys module, so you need to import it before using it.

Syntax: sys.getsizeof(object)

Example:
'''

import sys
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(sys.getsizeof(x))  # Output: Size of the list object in bytes


'''These functions provide valuable information for debugging, profiling, and optimizing Python code. They are commonly used in scenarios where you need to inspect objects, check their types, or analyze memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets or performance-sensitive applications.'''
