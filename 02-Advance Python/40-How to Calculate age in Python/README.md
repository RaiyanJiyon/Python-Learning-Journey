# How to Calculate age in Python

To calculate age in Python, you typically need the birthdate of the person and the current date. You can then subtract the birthdate from the current date to get the difference, which represents the person's age.

Here's a basic example of how you can calculate age in Python using the datetime module:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_age(birthdate):
    # Get the current date
    current_date = datetime.now()

    # Calculate the difference between current date and birthdate
    age = current_date.year - birthdate.year - ((current_date.month, current_date.day) < (birthdate.month, birthdate.day))

    return age

# Example birthdate (year, month, day)
birthdate = datetime(1990, 4, 15)

# Calculate age
age = calculate_age(birthdate)
print("Age:", age)
```

In this example:

- We define a function calculate_age() that takes the birthdate as input.

- We get the current date using datetime.now().

- We calculate the difference in years between the current date and the birthdate.

- We adjust the age based on whether the current month and day are before the birth month and day. If the birth month and day have not yet occurred in the current year, we subtract 1 from the age.

- Finally, we return the calculated age.

You can customize this function according to your specific requirements, such as handling different date formats or incorporating timezones. Additionally, you may want to consider edge cases such as leap years and invalid dates.
