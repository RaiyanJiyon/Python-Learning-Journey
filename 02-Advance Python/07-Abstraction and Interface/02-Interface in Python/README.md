# Interface in Python

In Python, interfaces are not explicitly defined as a language construct, as they are in some other programming languages like Java or C#. However, Python provides a mechanism to achieve similar functionality through abstract base classes (ABCs) and abstract methods.

An interface defines a contract for what methods a class must implement, without providing any implementation details. Classes that implement the interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods specified by the interface.

Python's abc module provides support for defining abstract base classes and abstract methods, which can be used to create interfaces. Here's an example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Drawable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Circle(Drawable):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing a circle")

class Square(Drawable):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing a square")

# Trying to instantiate an abstract class raises an error
# drawable = Drawable()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Drawable with abstract methods draw

# Creating instances of Circle and Square
circle = Circle()
square = Square()

# Calling the draw method on Circle and Square objects
circle.draw()  # Output: Drawing a circle
square.draw()  # Output: Drawing a square
```

In this example:

- Drawable is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines an interface with one abstract method, draw().

- Circle and Square are concrete classes that implement the Drawable interface by providing concrete implementations for the draw() method.

While Python does not have explicit language support for interfaces, abstract base classes and abstract methods can be used to achieve similar functionality. This allows you to define contracts for classes to adhere to, promoting code abstraction, modularity, and reusability.
