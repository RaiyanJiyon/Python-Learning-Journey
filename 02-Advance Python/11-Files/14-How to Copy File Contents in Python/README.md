# How to Copy File Contents in Python

To copy the contents of one file to another file in Python, you can follow these general steps:

1. Open the source file for reading.
2. Open the destination file for writing.
3. Read the contents of the source file.
4. Write the contents to the destination file.
5. Close both files.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to copy the contents of one file to another:

```python
def copy_file(source_file, destination_file):
    try:
        # Open the source file for reading
        with open(source_file, "r") as src_file:
            # Open the destination file for writing
            with open(destination_file, "w") as dest_file:
                # Read the contents of the source file
                contents = src_file.read()
                # Write the contents to the destination file
                dest_file.write(contents)
        print("File copied successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)

# Example usage
copy_file("source.txt", "destination.txt")
```

In this example:

- We define a function copy_file that takes two arguments: source_file (the path to the source file) and destination_file (the path to the destination file).
- Inside the function, we use a nested with statement to open both the source and destination files.
- We read the contents of the source file using the read() method and store them in the contents variable.
Then, we write the contents to the destination file using the write() method.
- Finally, we print a success message if the copying process completes without errors, or an error message if an exception occurs.
Make sure to replace "source.txt" and "destination.txt" with the actual paths to your source and destination files, respectively.

This is a basic example, and depending on your requirements, you may need to handle additional cases, such as binary files, large files, error handling, and more.
