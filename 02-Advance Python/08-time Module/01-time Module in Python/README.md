# time Module in Python

The time module in Python provides various time-related functions, including functions for working with timestamps, measuring time intervals, and formatting time values. Here are some of the commonly used functions and constants provided by the time module:

- `time()`: Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).
- `sleep(seconds)`: Suspends the execution of the current thread for the specified number of seconds.
- `ctime(seconds)`: Converts a timestamp (seconds since the epoch) into a string representing the local time in a human-readable format.
- `gmtime(seconds)`: Converts a timestamp into a struct_time object representing the time in UTC.
- `localtime(seconds)`: Converts a timestamp into a struct_time object representing the local time.
- `strftime(format, struct_time)`: Converts a struct_time object or a tuple representing time into a string according to the specified format.
- `strptime(string, format)`: Parses a string representing time according to the specified format and returns a struct_time object.
- `time_ns()`: Returns the current time in nanoseconds since the epoch (Python 3.7 and later).

Here's a simple example demonstrating some of the functions in the time module:

```python
import time

# Get current time
current_time = time.time()
print("Current time:", current_time)

# Sleep for 2 seconds
print("Sleeping for 2 seconds...")
time.sleep(2)
print("Woke up!")

# Convert timestamp to a string
formatted_time = time.ctime(current_time)
print("Formatted time:", formatted_time)

# Convert timestamp to struct_time objects
utc_time = time.gmtime(current_time)
local_time = time.localtime(current_time)
print("UTC time:", utc_time)
print("Local time:", local_time)

# Format time
formatted_utc_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", utc_time)
formatted_local_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", local_time)
print("Formatted UTC time:", formatted_utc_time)
print("Formatted local time:", formatted_local_time)
```

The time module is a fundamental part of Python's standard library and is commonly used for tasks such as measuring execution time, scheduling tasks, and working with timestamps in various applications.
