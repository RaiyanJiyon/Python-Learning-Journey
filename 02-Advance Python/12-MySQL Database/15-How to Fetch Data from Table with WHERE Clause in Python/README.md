# How to Fetch Data from Table with WHERE Clause in Python

To fetch data from a table with a WHERE clause in Python, you'll typically use a specific database library corresponding to the type of database you're working with. Here's a general outline of how you can accomplish this using MySQL as an example with the mysql-connector-python library:

1. **Install MySQL Connector/Python:**
If you haven't already installed MySQL Connector/Python, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

2. **Connect to the Database:**

```python
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection to the MySQL database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='database_name'
)

# Check if the connection is successful
if connection.is_connected():
    print("Connected to MySQL database")
else:
    print("Failed to connect to MySQL database")
```

Replace 'localhost', 'username', 'password', and 'database_name' with the appropriate values for your MySQL setup.

3. **Fetch Data from the Table with WHERE Clause:**

```python
# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Define SQL query with a WHERE clause to fetch data from the table
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > %s"

# Parameters for the WHERE clause
parameters = (25,)

# Execute SQL query to fetch data with WHERE clause
cursor.execute(sql_query, parameters)

# Fetch all rows of data
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Display the fetched data
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

## Full Example:
Putting it all together:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection to the MySQL database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='database_name'
)

# Check if the connection is successful
if connection.is_connected():
    print("Connected to MySQL database")
else:
    print("Failed to connect to MySQL database")

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Define SQL query with a WHERE clause to fetch data from the table
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > %s"

# Parameters for the WHERE clause
parameters = (25,)

# Execute SQL query to fetch data with WHERE clause
cursor.execute(sql_query, parameters)

# Fetch all rows of data
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Display the fetched data
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

This example demonstrates how to fetch data from a table with a WHERE clause in Python using MySQL Connector/Python. You can adapt this example to work with other databases by using the appropriate library and modifying the SQL queries accordingly. Adjust the SQL query and parameters to match your specific requirements for the WHERE clause.
