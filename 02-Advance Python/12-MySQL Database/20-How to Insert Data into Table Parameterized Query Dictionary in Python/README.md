# How to Insert Data into Table Parameterized Query Dictionary in Python

To insert data into a table using a parameterized query dictionary in Python, you can provide a dictionary where the keys correspond to the column names and the values correspond to the data to be inserted. Here's how you can accomplish this using MySQL as an example with the mysql-connector-python library:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection to the MySQL database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='database_name'
)

# Check if the connection is successful
if connection.is_connected():
    print("Connected to MySQL database")
else:
    print("Failed to connect to MySQL database")

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Define SQL query for inserting data into the table with parameters
sql_query = "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (%(name)s, %(age)s)"

# Data to be inserted into the table (dictionary)
data = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25
}

# Execute parameterized SQL query to insert data
cursor.execute(sql_query, data)

# Commit the transaction
connection.commit()

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

In this example, the data dictionary contains the column names as keys and the corresponding data values to be inserted into the table. The %() syntax is used in the SQL query to reference the keys in the dictionary.

This approach is more readable and convenient when dealing with a large number of columns or when the column order may change.

You can adapt this example to work with other databases by using the appropriate library and modifying the SQL queries accordingly. Adjust the SQL query and data dictionary to match your specific requirements.
