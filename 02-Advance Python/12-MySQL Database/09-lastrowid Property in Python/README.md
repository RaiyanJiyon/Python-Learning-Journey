# lastrowid Property in Python

The lastrowid property in Python is used to retrieve the ID of the last row inserted into a table with an auto-incrementing primary key column. It is typically used after executing an SQL INSERT statement to get the value of the auto-incremented primary key for the newly inserted row.

Here's how you can use the lastrowid property with MySQL Connector/Python:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection to the MySQL database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='database_name'
)

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute an SQL INSERT statement
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30)")

# Retrieve the ID of the last row inserted
last_row_id = cursor.lastrowid
print("ID of the last row inserted:", last_row_id)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

In this example:

- After executing the INSERT statement with the cursor object, the lastrowid property is used to retrieve the ID of the last row inserted into the users table.
- The retrieved last_row_id value represents the auto-incremented primary key value assigned to the newly inserted row.

It's important to note that the lastrowid property may return None if the table does not have an auto-incrementing primary key column or if the database does not support the retrieval of the last row ID. Therefore, you should always check the documentation of your database library for any specific behavior related to the lastrowid property.
