# Prepared Statement in Python

In Python, a prepared statement is a way to execute SQL queries with placeholders for parameters. It's a feature provided by database libraries to improve performance and security by pre-compiling SQL queries before execution.

Here's how you can use prepared statements with parameterized queries using the mysql-connector-python library:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection to the MySQL database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='database_name'
)

# Check if the connection is successful
if connection.is_connected():
    print("Connected to MySQL database")
else:
    print("Failed to connect to MySQL database")

# Create a cursor object with prepared statement enabled
cursor = connection.cursor(prepared=True)

# Define SQL query for inserting data into the table with parameters
sql_query = "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (%s, %s)"

# Data to be inserted into the table (tuple)
data = ("Alice", 25)

# Execute parameterized SQL query with prepared statement to insert data
cursor.execute(sql_query, data)

# Commit the transaction
connection.commit()

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

In this example:

- We create a connection to the MySQL database as usual.
- We set prepared=True when creating the cursor object to enable prepared statement mode.
- We define an SQL query with placeholders for parameters.
- We execute the SQL query with the execute() method, passing the data as a tuple.
- The database library handles the parameterization and execution of the query efficiently, using a prepared statement under the hood.

Using prepared statements can improve performance because the database server can cache and reuse the pre-compiled statement for subsequent executions with different parameter values. Additionally, prepared statements help prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically escaping input parameters.

You can adapt this example to work with other database libraries by using their corresponding methods for enabling prepared statements and executing parameterized queries. Adjust the SQL query and parameter format to match the requirements of your database library.
