# Difference between Error and Exception in Python

In Python, errors and exceptions are closely related concepts, but they have distinct meanings:

**Error:**
- An error refers to any problem that prevents the program from executing as expected.
- Errors can occur due to various reasons such as syntax errors, runtime errors, or logical errors.
  - Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language and cannot be executed at all. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase.
  - Runtime errors occur during the execution of the program and are also known as exceptions. These errors can occur due to division by zero, accessing a non-existent index of a list, etc.
  - Logical errors, also known as bugs, occur when the code does not produce the expected result due to a mistake in the program's logic.

**Exception:**
- An exception is a special type of error that occurs during the execution of a Python program and disrupts the normal flow of the program.
- Exceptions are raised when a Python operation fails to execute properly, such as division by zero, accessing an index out of range, or attempting to open a non-existent file.
- Exceptions are instances of classes that derive from the built-in `BaseException` class or one of its subclasses, such as `Exception`.
- Python provides a mechanism to catch and handle exceptions using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
- By handling exceptions gracefully, you can prevent your program from crashing and take appropriate action to recover from errors or display meaningful error messages to users.

In summary, errors are problems that prevent the program from running correctly, whereas exceptions are raised during the execution of the program when an operation fails to execute properly. Exceptions can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms provided by Python.
