# Assert Statement in Python

In Python, the assert statement is used as a debugging aid to test whether a condition is true. If the condition evaluates to False, an AssertionError exception is raised with an optional error message.

Here's the basic syntax of the assert statement:

```python
assert condition, message
```

**Condition:** The expression to be tested. If it evaluates to True, the program continues execution as usual. If it evaluates to False, an AssertionError exception is raised.
**Message (optional):** An optional error message that is displayed when the condition evaluates to False. This message helps to provide additional context about the cause of the assertion failure.

Here's an example of how you can use the assert statement:

```python
def divide(x, y):
    assert y != 0, "Cannot divide by zero"
    return x / y

result = divide(10, 0)  # This will raise an AssertionError with the message "Cannot divide by zero"
```

In this example:

1. We define a function `divide()` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`.
2. We use the `assert` statement to check whether `y` is not equal to zero. If `y` is zero, the assertion fails, and an `AssertionError` is raised with the message "Cannot divide by zero".
3. We call the `divide()` function with `x = 10` and `y = 0`, which triggers the assertion failure and raises an `AssertionError`.

The `assert` statement is commonly used during development to check assumptions about the correctness of code. It helps to catch logical errors and invalid states early in the development process.

It's important to note that assertions can be disabled globally using the `-O` or `-OO` command-line options or the `PYTHONOPTIMIZE` environment variable. When optimizations are enabled, all `assert` statements are effectively ignored, and the associated code is not executed. Therefore, assertions should not be used for data validation or input sanitization in production code. Instead, use explicit error handling mechanisms such as `if` statements and exception handling.
