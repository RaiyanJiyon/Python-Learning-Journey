# Thread Synchronization Semaphore and BoundedSemaphore in Python

In Python, thread synchronization mechanisms such as Semaphore and BoundedSemaphore are used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads. They allow only a specified number of threads to access the shared resource simultaneously, thereby preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.

Here's an explanation of Semaphore and BoundedSemaphore:

**Semaphore:**
- A Semaphore is a synchronization primitive that maintains a counter representing the number of available resources.
- Threads can acquire and release resources using the `acquire()` and `release()` methods, respectively.
- If the counter is greater than zero, the `acquire()` method decrements the counter and allows the thread to proceed. If the counter is zero, the thread blocks until a resource becomes available.
- The `release()` method increments the counter, indicating that a resource has been released and becomes available for other threads to acquire.

**BoundedSemaphore:**
- A BoundedSemaphore is a subclass of Semaphore with an additional constraint on the maximum value of the counter.
- Unlike a Semaphore, which allows the counter to increase indefinitely, a BoundedSemaphore restricts the counter to a maximum value specified during initialization.
- The primary difference between Semaphore and BoundedSemaphore is that a BoundedSemaphore prevents the counter from exceeding the specified maximum value, whereas a Semaphore does not have this restriction.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of Semaphore and BoundedSemaphore in Python:

```python
import threading

# Create a Semaphore with a maximum value of 2
semaphore = threading.Semaphore(2)

# Define a function that simulates accessing a shared resource
def access_resource(thread_id):
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} is trying to access the resource")
    with semaphore:
        print(f"Thread {thread_id} has acquired the resource")
        # Simulate performing some work
        print(f"Thread {thread_id} is performing some work")
        # Simulate releasing the resource
        print(f"Thread {thread_id} has released the resource")

# Create multiple threads to access the shared resource
threads = []
for i in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=access_resource, args=(i,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

In this example:

- We create a Semaphore with a maximum value of 2, limiting access to the shared resource to two threads simultaneously.
- We define a function access_resource() that simulates accessing the shared resource. The function uses a with statement to acquire and release the Semaphore.
- We create five threads, each of which calls the access_resource() function.
- The Semaphore ensures that only two threads can access the resource simultaneously, while the other threads block until a resource becomes available.

You can use Semaphore and BoundedSemaphore to synchronize access to shared resources and coordinate the execution of multiple threads in Python programs.
