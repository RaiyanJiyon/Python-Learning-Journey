# Writing Data to File using write Method in Python

To write data to a file in Python, you can use the write() method available on file objects. This method allows you to write string data to the file. Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use the write() method:

```python
# Open a file in write mode (creates a new file or truncates existing content)
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    # Write data to the file
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a test file.\n")
    file.write("Writing data to a file.\n")
    file.write("End of file.")
```

In this example:

- We open a file named "example.txt" in write mode using a context manager (with statement). If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated (cleared).
- We use the write() method to write string data to the file. Each call to write() adds data to the file sequentially.
- We add newline characters \n at the end of each line to ensure that each string is written on a separate line.

After executing this code, the file "example.txt" will contain the following content:

```
Hello, World!
This is a test file.
Writing data to a file.
End of file.
```

Remember to always close the file after writing to ensure that all data is properly flushed to disk. In this example, the file is automatically closed when exiting the with statement due to the context manager.
